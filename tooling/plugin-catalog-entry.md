# Plugin catalog entry template

Use this template when adding a plugin to the root README or when a plugin's durable purpose has changed enough to revise its existing entry. The plugin workspace manifests are the inventory; every workspace under `plugins/*` needs exactly one catalog entry.

## Add a plugin

1. Create the plugin with `npm run new:plugin -- --slug <slug> --name <name> --description <purpose>`.
2. Finish and verify the user-facing workflow before writing catalog copy.
3. List the plugin's major user-visible states, then capture enough representative screenshots from the real rift interface to show every one. One image may cover multiple states when each remains legible. Store them under `plugins/<slug>/docs/` and reference the complete set from the root README; reference at least one from the plugin README too.
4. Add the entry in the same order as `node tooling/plugin-workspaces.mjs`.
5. Run the verification checklist below.

```markdown
### <Display name>

<One or two sentences describing the durable user purpose and core capabilities.>

![<Specific state visible in the screenshot>](plugins/<slug>/docs/<screenshot>.png)

<!-- Repeat for each additional major state that is not already legible above. -->

[Source](plugins/<slug>) · [README](plugins/<slug>/README.md)

Install: `rift plugin install "path:$PWD/plugins/<slug>" --yes`
```

## Write stable copy

Lead with the job the plugin does, then name only the few capabilities that define that job. Prefer language that will remain true across refactors, dependency updates, and small UI changes.

Do not mention SDK versions, internal APIs, branch names, implementation classes, migration details, or the latest bug fix. Those details belong in the plugin README, pull request, or release notes.

Change an existing description when the plugin gains, loses, or materially changes a core user workflow. Do not rewrite it for visual polish, bug fixes, performance work, dependency or SDK updates, test changes, or implementation refactors when the durable purpose remains the same.

## Update screenshots

- Use the real rift interface and the current plugin source, with a fixture that makes the capability immediately legible.
- Inventory the durable interaction states before capturing. Cover every major state promised by the description—for example, both thread and section cards, or a selection action, anchored pill, reply composer, agent handoff, and aggregate list.
- Prefer stable, representative states over edge cases or transient loading states. A single image may demonstrate several states only when each is large enough to understand without opening the source image separately.
- Keep images in `plugins/<slug>/docs/`. Replace a stale image in place when it demonstrates the same state; add a clearly named image when it demonstrates a distinct capability.
- Write alt text that names what is visibly demonstrated, not merely the plugin name. Do not claim behavior the image does not show.
- Refresh a screenshot when the represented workflow, product chrome, or visual result has materially changed. Routine code changes do not require a new capture.

## Verify the catalog

1. Run `node tooling/plugin-workspaces.mjs` and compare every emitted plugin name and path with the root README.
2. Inspect every referenced image and confirm its file exists, decodes, renders at a useful size, matches its alt text, and collectively covers every major state named in the plugin's catalog description.
3. Run `npm run hygiene`; it verifies inventory links, install refs, plugin README coverage, and representative screenshot paths.
4. Run `git diff --check` and inspect `git diff -- README.md CONTRIBUTING.md .rift/AGENTS.md tooling/plugin-catalog-entry.md plugins/*/docs` for stale entries or unrelated changes.
