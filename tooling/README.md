# Repository tooling

This folder holds the small amount of machinery the plugins genuinely share. Runtime code, SDK declarations, tests, and UI components stay with the plugin that owns them.

## Commands

| Command | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run check` | Checks the repository, then typechecks, builds, tests, and validates every plugin. |
| `npm run check --workspace=<package>` | Runs one plugin's own focused check. |
| `npm run new:plugin -- --slug <slug> --name <name> --description <purpose>` | Creates a plugin, installs dependencies, and runs its first typecheck, test, and build. |
| `npm run scaffold:smoke` | Creates a temporary plugin and proves the scaffold still works after a clean install. |

## Shared scripts

| Script | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`plugin-workspaces.mjs`](plugin-workspaces.mjs) | Finds plugins and reads their names and stable IDs from their manifests. |
| [`build-plugin.mjs`](build-plugin.mjs) | Gives every workspace the same `rift plugin build` entrypoint. |
| [`check-repository.mjs`](check-repository.mjs) | Catches drift in manifests, lockfiles, READMEs, screenshots, skills, workflows, and layout. |
| [`validate-plugin-artifacts.mjs`](validate-plugin-artifacts.mjs) | Makes sure production bundles contain everything rift needs to install them. |
| [`create-plugin.mjs`](create-plugin.mjs) | Starts a plugin with package scripts, local SDK declarations, and a focused test. |
| [`scaffold-smoke.mjs`](scaffold-smoke.mjs) | Runs the generator inside a clean temporary repository. |
| [`publish-install-refs.mjs`](publish-install-refs.mjs) | Retained upstream install-ref tooling; automatic publication is disabled in this fork. |

## Boundaries

There is no shared runtime package. Generated SDK declarations and vendored UI stay plugin-local, while repeated setup belongs in the generator. A helper moves under `packages/` only after at least two real plugins depend on the same stable behavior.

The real Rift SDK 0.4.48 archive is vendored for reproducible validation before npm publication. The pinned SDK archive under [`vendor/`](vendor/) keeps clean installs reproducible. [`sdk-provenance.json`](vendor/sdk-provenance.json) records where it came from and verifies its contents.
