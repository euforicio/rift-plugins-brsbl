# Endless

Frank Ocean's *Endless* as a rift theme family: `endless`, the achromatic
silver print, and `endless-color`, the same structure with rare pops sampled
from the film's painted stair.

Released August 19, 2016. This is the ten-year mark.

## Install

```bash
rift plugin install "path:$PWD/plugins/endless" --yes
```

## Use

Activate either palette:

```bash
rift theme set plugin:endless:endless          # the silver print
rift theme set plugin:endless:endless-color    # silver + the stair accents
```

The palette is app-wide and stored server-side; light/dark mode stays a separate
per-client setting that each stylesheet layers on top of, so one theme covers
both. `rift theme reset` returns to the default without touching your favicon
color.

## The family

`endless-color` is generated from the `endless` stylesheet plus appended
light and dark override blocks in [`build/build-color.py`](build/build-color.py),
and a test asserts that derivation byte-for-byte. Radius, type, the sidebar
material and every
structural rule are therefore shared by construction — the variant can only
differ where it deliberately overrides: the silver field, the stair accents
(light blue, mustard, orange, red, olive), the foil violet, and the plywood
trim.

The complete generators and reference imagery live in [`build/`](build/),
outside the package `files` allowlist so installed plugins do not carry the
authoring sources. [`build/PROVENANCE.md`](build/PROVENANCE.md) records each
measured colour, its source region, exact value, and nearest pixel in the
committed image.

Type across the family follows the album's liner notes: Helvetica for the UI,
Courier for code, paths and terminals. Both are system faces — nothing is
embedded.

## The design

The album is a black-and-white visual record: a grainy near-black field, two
silver-gelatin photographs, printers' registration marks in the corners, a
greyscale step wedge down each edge, and a warehouse ceiling of fluorescent
tubes. Five moves carry that into a UI palette.

**Achromatic.** There is no accent hue. The neutral ramp is a warm-toned silver
print — the step wedge from the cover's edge strips — and every surface, border
and text tier is drawn from it.

**Light is the accent.** In dark mode `--primary` is pure `#ffffff`, the
fluorescent tube. Body text sits a step below at `#f4f1ec`, so a primary button
or a link reads as literally *lit* rather than merely tinted. Light mode inverts
the idea: `--primary` becomes `#0d0d10`, a slab of ink on paper.

**Squared.** `--radius` drops to `0`. Photographic prints, crop marks and
registration targets have no rounded corners.

**Two tones, not one.** Body text is warm-toned; file paths and the timeline are
cold (`#9fb8c4`). Two prints from the same negative, developed in different
chemistry. It is the only temperature shift in the theme, so it does an accent
color's job without adding one.

Semantics keep their hue but are toned rather than saturated, like a hand-tinted
print: destructive is the darkroom safelight, warning is sepia, success is
selenium, merged is a dusty violet. The ANSI terminal palette is deliberately
left at rift's defaults — a greyscale remap would erase the one place in the app
where color is load-bearing rather than decorative.

## Notes for anyone editing the stylesheet

**Canvas grain stays off.** Earlier builds raised both `--canvas` anchors to
compensate for a page-wide film-grain overlay. The canvas is now the measured
field directly. The sidebar keeps a separate paper mottle in light mode and a
zero-mean highlight/shadow grain in dark mode, so its texture does not lift the
surface away from the contrast value being tested.

**Panels sit above the field.** In dark mode cards, popovers and code wells sit
a step above the canvas rather than below it — the cover's own logic, where the
photographs are the lit planes and the black is the surround.

**`:root` beats rift's `.dark`.** They have equal specificity and this sheet loads
last, so every token pinned in the light block is pinned again in the dark block.
Dropping one leaks its light value into dark mode.

Contrast floors held throughout: text ≥ 4.5:1, non-text UI ≥ 3:1, including the
tight cases (the secondary text tiers over the hover fill).

**Code colors are not part of this plugin.** rift's plugin manifest accepts only
`{ id, name, description, css }` per theme — there is no field for a Pierre /
VS Code code theme, and the plugin SDK's `ThemeArea` is read-and-activate only.
So `rift theme show` reports `pierre-dark / pierre-light` for this palette: diff
*line* colors still follow `--diff-added` / `--diff-removed` from the stylesheet,
but syntax highlighting inside code blocks uses rift's default hues rather than
this theme's toned monochrome. A matching pair exists and works when the palette
is installed the other way, as a custom theme folder under
`<rift-data-dir>/theme/endless/` alongside `pierre-dark.json` / `pierre-light.json`.

**Fonts are system-native.** The family uses Helvetica Neue and Courier with
portable fallbacks; it embeds no font files. `theme.test.ts` fails the build if
a machine-specific path appears in either generated stylesheet.

## Develop

From the monorepo root:

```bash
npm ci
python3 plugins/endless/build/build.py 0.13 0.18 plugins/endless/themes/endless.css local
python3 plugins/endless/build/build-color.py plugins/endless/themes/endless-color.css plugins/endless/themes/endless.css
npm run check --workspace=rift-plugin-endless
rift plugin install "path:$PWD/plugins/endless" --yes
```
