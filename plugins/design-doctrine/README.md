# Design Doctrine

Design Doctrine keeps the lessons that recur in design reviews from getting lost in old threads. It gives agents a set of rules they can search and apply while they design, build, or critique.

## Install

```bash
rift plugin install "path:$PWD/plugins/design-doctrine" --yes
```

## Use

Open **Design Doctrine** from the rift sidebar when you want to browse the rules. Agents receive a small set of candidates inferred from the thread title and can use the native Doctrine search tool for the exact task. The same ranked search is available directly:

```bash
rift doctrine search "<task and surface>"
rift doctrine show ddr_001
```

The bundled `design-doctrine` skill validates each candidate against its applicability and exceptions before use. The doctrine adds personal design judgment; it does not replace product requirements, accessibility guidance, or platform conventions.

Maintenance needs no setup for correctness. When the plugin is installed from a checkout of this repository it keeps its own corpus checkout under rift's plugin data directory and reconciles a missed update on the next stale read with a lightweight remote-ref probe. An optional signature-verified GitHub push webhook at `/api/v1/plugins/design-doctrine/http/github` makes merged rule changes live within seconds; its shared secret is stored in the secret `githubWebhookSecret` setting. An install from the marketplace reads the rules it shipped with. Set `doctrinePath` only to read rules from somewhere else:

```bash
rift plugin config design-doctrine set doctrinePath /path/to/plugins/design-doctrine
```

## How it was built

The library grew out of feedback I kept giving in rift threads: direct requests, corrections, approvals, and rejections. The plugin queues visible user threads when they become idle, then its weekly maintenance pass reads only the unseen part of each episode through rift's timeline API. Agent output is not evidence by itself, and a pattern repeated across threads matters more than a one-off preference.

Every rule change is published as a pull request that merges itself once the repository's required checks pass, so the corpus is CI-validated without anyone reviewing a queue.

Rules are plain Markdown files under `rules/<domain>/`, so their reasoning and revisions remain easy to inspect in Git. [`governance.md`](governance.md) explains what qualifies as evidence and when it should become a rule.

## Develop

From the monorepo root:

```bash
npm ci
npm run check --workspace=rift-plugin-design-doctrine
rift plugin install "path:$PWD/plugins/design-doctrine" --yes
```
