# Doctrine maintenance pass

One bounded pass over new rift design feedback. `governance.md` covers the rules;
this is the procedure.

Limits: change at most five rule files per run. Don't touch plugin code, the
skill, or `governance.md`. Only the user's own messages are evidence — never
agent output, including your own.

Run from the worktree rift provisioned for this run. It is a fresh checkout of
the repository on its own branch, so rule edits cannot disturb any other
checkout and nothing has to be configured by hand. Rules live at
`plugins/design-doctrine/rules`; every path below is relative to the worktree
root.

## Steps

1. Read completed, queued episodes through the plugin's thread-history API and
   retain the returned `lease_id`. Per-thread checkpoints prevent rereading old
   episodes, and the lease prevents concurrent runs from processing the same
   batch. These bounds are larger than the defaults so a daily pass keeps up
   with the queue.

   ```bash
   rift doctrine history scan \
     --limit 400 \
     --max-bytes 1048576 \
     --max-message-bytes 8192
   ```

   Episodes whose user messages carry no design signal, and episodes older than
   the review window, are advanced automatically and never reach you; the
   result reports them as `skipped_episode_count`. A fresh install establishes a
   current baseline and does not replay feedback already represented by the
   existing doctrine. The plugin normally queues
   visible user threads as they become idle; a startup and monthly inventory
   reconciliation recovers idle events missed during downtime. If `lease_id`
   is `null`, history is caught up. Report that there is no new feedback and
   stop; do not call `advance` or `release`.

2. Review the returned `episodes` directly. Each episode contains the unseen
   user and assistant conversation rows after that thread's checkpoint, ending
   at an idle boundary. User messages can be evidence; assistant messages are
   context for the attempted result and outcome, never evidence by themselves.
   Do not reopen the whole thread log. Ignore tool failures and temporary
   constraints. When an episode has `complete: false`, assess only the returned
   slice; the next pass will receive the remainder after a successful advance.

3. For each durable signal, take the smallest action that fits:

   - nothing;
   - add an Evidence line to an existing rule and bump `supporting_episodes`;
   - tighten "Use when" / "Do not use when", or add an Exceptions section;
   - write a new rule at `plugins/design-doctrine/rules/<domain>/ddr_NNN.md`;
   - retire a replaced rule (`status: retired`) and point its replacement at it
     through `relations`;
   - set `status: conflicted`, add the challenging evidence, bump
     `challenging_episodes`, and ask the user.

   Update `confidence` to match the evidence and set `updated` to today.

4. A new rule needs the same frontmatter as its neighbours — `id`, `kind`,
   `strength`, `confidence`, `status`, `domain`, `products`, `activities`,
   `artifacts`, `surfaces`, `relations`, `supporting_episodes`,
   `challenging_episodes`, `updated` — and the sections Why, Prefer, Avoid,
   Use when, Do not use when, Evidence, Check.

5. Keep evidence lines short and anonymous: one line per episode, describing
   what the user asked for or corrected. Never paste transcripts, credentials,
   private URLs, thread IDs, or message IDs.

6. If nothing changed, skip to step 8. Otherwise validate this worktree's rules
   and commit only rule files:

   ```bash
   git diff --check -- plugins/design-doctrine/rules
   rift doctrine validate "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/plugins/design-doctrine"
   git add -- plugins/design-doctrine/rules
   git commit -m "doctrine: <what changed>" -- plugins/design-doctrine/rules
   ```

   If any of these fails, stop: do not commit, do not publish, and do not
   advance. Go to the release command in step 8, report the failure, and leave
   this thread open.

   `rift doctrine validate <path>` parses every rule under that path and enforces
   the live schema, evidence counts, relations, and lifecycle constraints. Pass
   an absolute path to this worktree's own plugin directory: a relative path
   would be resolved somewhere else entirely, and could report a different
   corpus as clean. Check the `root` it prints is inside this worktree.

7. Publish the batch as a pull request that merges itself once the
   repository's required checks pass. Do not wait for CI and do not merge by
   hand.

   ```bash
   branch="doctrine/$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
   git push origin "HEAD:refs/heads/$branch"
   gh pr create --head "$branch" --fill
   gh pr merge "$branch" --auto --squash
   ```

   Publish under `doctrine/` so the batch is visible to the stall check in step
   9 and to every later run. A branch named anything else is invisible to it,
   and a pull request that never merges would go unnoticed.

   If the push or the pull request fails, stop: do not advance. Release the
   lease as in step 8, report the failure, and leave this thread open. On
   success the plugin picks the rules up on its next corpus refresh, a couple
   of minutes after the merge. You do not wait for CI, so you cannot report its
   outcome — a run that fails CI surfaces as a stalled publication on a later
   pass.

8. Release the lease without advancing whenever the run could not safely
   finish — a failed validate, commit, push, or pull request:

   ```bash
   rift doctrine history release --lease-id <lease-id>
   ```

   Advancing is irreversible: it moves the checkpoints past feedback nobody
   read. Only advance after a pushed pull request, or after you deliberately
   decided nothing in the batch was worth changing:

   ```bash
   rift doctrine history advance --lease-id <lease-id>
   ```

9. Check whether an earlier batch is stuck before you finish:

   ```bash
   rift doctrine status --json
   ```

   A `stalled_publications` entry means an earlier doctrine pull request has not
   merged —
   a failing check, an unresolved review comment, or a conflict. Auto-merge
   waits indefinitely, so name it in your report; the corpus learns nothing
   further until it lands.

10. Archive this thread when the pass finished cleanly — rules published or
    nothing worth changing, no stalled publication, no rule left conflicted, no
    blocker:

    ```bash
    rift thread archive --self
    ```

    Do this last, after your report. Runs happen daily and a clean one is not
    worth a place in the thread list. Leave the thread open whenever the report
    needs a human: a stalled publication, a rule you set to `conflicted` and the
    question it needs, or anything that stopped you finishing.

Report what changed, the pull request URL, any stalled publication, anything
left conflicted and the question it needs, and the rule count. Keep no-change
runs to one sentence.
